second for grpc
    Without a middle proxy between mobile devices and the backend service,gRPC can integrate nicely with mobile devices.
    gRPC is more structured,grpc uses Protocol buffers so that can integrate two microservice each one has its own programming language.

Third for Kafka
    Kafka is a message queue that makes the application more reliable cause Kafka can handle massive events 
    without any waiting (Asynchronous).
    for our use case we need it to handle the recorded locations that will be relatively a lot of data with high-frequency requests.
